"""Reconcile the accepted offer against what actually happened. The webhook is the truth.

R4. Three signals arrive about one checkout and they are not equally trustworthy:

* ``accepted`` — the offer the buyer accepted. This is the **promise** being graded, not
  evidence about the outcome.
* ``checkout_pixel`` — a client-side observation. It is lossy by construction: ad blockers
  eat it, the tab closes before it fires, the discount block renders after it reads. It is
  useful for *noticing* that something happened and for *diagnosing* a gap, and it is never
  authoritative.
* ``order_paid`` — the ``orders/paid`` webhook. Server-to-server, signed, and the record the
  merchant's own books agree with. **Every integrity comparison derives from this event.**

That last rule is the whole ticket, and both directions of getting it wrong are real:

* a *wrong pixel* must not fail an honest store — a pixel that reports 90.00 against a
  webhook of 100.00 is a broken pixel, not a broken promise;
* a *matching pixel* must not mask a webhook discrepancy — a store whose pixel echoes the
  promise while the webhook charged 120.00 is exactly the fraud this system exists to catch,
  and averaging the two sources, or preferring whichever agrees with the offer, hides it.

So the pixel never enters a comparison. It is recorded (``pixel_missing``, ``pixel_price``,
``pixel_agrees``) because a pixel that persistently disagrees with the webhook is itself a
finding — but a finding about the *integration*, and one that a later ticket grades, not one
that moves a trust dimension here.

A dropped pixel is not an error: with the webhook alone the order still reconciles cleanly
and the gap is recorded as ``pixel_missing: true``. Refusing to reconcile without the pixel
would let a store suppress its own grading by breaking its own analytics.

No scoring happens here (T-061 non-goal "no score math"). This module emits one
``reconciled`` event per order; turning that into trust observations is :mod:`trust.scoring`'s
job through the published ``claim_type -> dimension`` table.
